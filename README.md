# Learning-Javascript

This is a project I am working on to learn javascript. As I learn it I will be putting all my code up here on github. All the code is commented for easy understanding so it is great for anyone to learn.

## How are the files arranged?
> Each file covers a different topic and has example code in it. If you want to **learn JavaScript for free** this github reposotiry is for you. It is an easy and simple way to learn the langauge and it comes with many examples.
